# Analysis-of-Growth-of-a-Company

This project was created by Tejas V Kangod. In this project, I have analysed data related to growth of a company and plotted the results. I have also identified reasons for dips in the growth and identified suitable corrections to be taken. I identified the nature of different types of users who visited the website and plotted graphs using necessary tools to represent it. Finally, I represented the nature of Quick Ratio.
